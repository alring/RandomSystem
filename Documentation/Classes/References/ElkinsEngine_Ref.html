<h2>CLASS DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p>The ElkinsEngine class implements a random number generator with a cycle length of 8.8 trillion.</p>

<p>Upon creation of an ElkinsEngine, the seeds are set using the system clock. Three calls are made to the system clock function, and for each the microseconds are used as the seed value. Thus, the relationships between the seeds are dependant upon system load.</p>

<p>The Elkins algorithm generates short integers (16 bits), but only 15 of those bits are pseudo-random. The same method is used in ElkinsEngine as in StandardEngine, i.e. 16 iterations of the algorithm are used, and one result is used to fill out the non-pseudo-random bit in each of the other results. This means the unit for ElkinsEngine is 15 short integers, or 30 bytes.</p>

<p>The algorithm used by the ElkinsEngine class is that given in the article:</p>

<p>	"A Higly Random Random-Number Generator" by T.A. Elkins</p>

<p>	Computer Language, 1989 December (Volume 6, Number 12), Page 59.</p>

<p>+ alloc</b></p>

<p>Returns a new uninitialized instance.</p>

<p><b>unit</b></p>

<p>+ (int)unit</b></p>

<h2>INSTANCE METHODS</h2>

<p><b>free</b></p>

<p>- free</b></p>

<p>Frees the memory occupied by the ElkinsEngine instance and returns nil</b>.</p>

<p><b>makeRandom:</b></p>

<p>- makeRandom:</b>(uchar *)<i>storage</b></p>

<p>Performs 16 iterations of the Elkins algorithm, and stuffs the results into </b>storage</i> (note that only 30 bytes of pseudo-random bits are generated).</p>
