<h2>CLASS DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p>The RandomEngine class is an abstract superclass for the types of classes usable by the Random class. An instance of a RandomEngine subclass is a source of pseudorandom bits usable by the Random class.</p>

<h2>METHOD TYPES</h2>

<p>Creating and freeing instances	+ alloc</p>

<p>- free</p>

<p>Generation of random bits	- makeRandom:</p>

<p>+ unit</p>

<p>Archiving	- read:</p>

<p>- write:</p>

<h2>CLASS METHODS</h2>

<p><b>alloc</b></p>

<p>+ alloc</b></p>

<p>Returns a new uninitialized instance.</p>

<p><b>unit</b></p>

<p>+ (int)unit</b></p>

<p>Returns the number of bytes each invocation of makeRandom:</b> will produce.</p>

<h2>INSTANCE METHODS</h2>

<p><b>free</b></p>

<p>- free</b></p>

<p>Frees the memory occupied by the RandomEngine instance and returns nil</b>.</p>

<p><b>makeRandom:</b></p>

<p>- makeRandom:</b>(uchar *)<i>storage</b></p>

<p>It is the subclass' responsibility to implement this method. The subclass should store the number of bytes returned by the </i>unit</b> method into the buffer pointed to by <i>storage</i>.</p>

<p><b>read:</b></p>

<p>- read:</b>(TypedStream *)<i>stream</i></p>

<p>Unarchives a RandomEngine from stream</i>.</p>

<p><b>write:</b></p>

<p>- write:</b>(TypedStream *)<i>stream</i></p>

<p>Archives a RandomEngine to stream</i>.</p>
