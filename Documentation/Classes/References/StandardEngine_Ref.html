<h1>StandardEngine</h1>

<p>Version 2.1: Written by Gregor N. Purdy.</p>

<p>Copyright &copy; 1991-2004 Gregor N. Purdy. All rights reserved.</p>

<p>INHERITS FROM	RandomEngine</p>

<h2>CLASS DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p>The StandardEngine class is a wrapper for the standard C/UNIX rand() and srand() functions supplied on the NeXT computer. An instance of the StandardEngine class can be a source of pseudorandom bits usable by the Random class.</p>

<p>Note that rand() generates only 31 pseudo-random bits per call and the Random class expects multiples of 8 bits. Rather than throw away 7 of the 31 bits (to leave 24), StandardEngine generates 32 words (each with 31 pseudo-random bits). One of those words is used as a source of high-order bits for the other 31. So, StandardEngine generates a unit of 31 words or 124 bytes at a shot. </p>

<p>This class is part of Version 2.1 of Random, distributed 2004 May 01.</p>
