pre 1990 Mar 23

  Used random number generation algorithm from K&R.

1990 Mar 23

  Modified to use algorithm with cycle length of 8.8 trillion.

1990 Mar 26

  * Added archiving.
  * Added randMax:, randMin:Max:, and percent:.

1991 Apr 26

  * Changed to use +alloc and -init as all NeXTStep 2.0 objects should.

2004 May 04

  * New version, 2.2
  * Now works on ix86 Linux (compiles without error, and its tests run)
  * Removed redundant copies of source files in examples
  * Ported -read: and -write: methods to use GCC's Objective-C runtime
    functions (this will probably break on MacOS X -- we are going to
    need to switch in different archiving code for MacOS X)
